üëã Hey there! My name's Nicola! I am a full stack developer who works in the MERN stack. I have a passion for imagining things I would like to build and making those ideas come to life. I love to learn new things and growing that knowledge over time. When I got the urge to learn how to code, I immediately knew that I had stumbled upon something that would change the way I viewed my career aspirations forever. I'm enthusiastic about my upcoming opportunities to evolve as a developer!

**What I Do**   

‚å®Ô∏è I have successful built several (Kirby-less) applications that utilize industry standards for code organization, web design, and optimization. When developing applications, I use a human-first approach -- this allows for me to structure and scale data efficiently based on predictable user needs. I have maximized the capabilities of tools such as MongoDB, React, Node.js, and Express to serve data and modularized front-end components to create an enriching user experience. I possess a strong appetite for learning and solving complex problems, therefore I'm looking to join a diverse team of motivated individuals who I can learn from and also share my unique perspective with.

**So... how did I get here?**  

‚≠êÔ∏è One day, I was experimenting with the <a style="color: #FE9CD0; font-weight: bold;" href="https://notion-enhancer.github.io/">Notion Enhancer</a> extension and dove into the CSS files. Calling on some old knowledge from creating themes on tumblr, I spent the entire day tweaking and testing my changes. I was thrilled and in that same day I enrolled in Codecademy courses and begin learning the basics. A few months later I enrolled in a Bootcamp at Butler University and passed the course with flying colors! I'm currently looking for work to start my new career and employ my unique background.
